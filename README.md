# Austin-House-Price-Prediction
This project is about predicting the housing price for Austin as it is one of the hottest markets in 2023, and these price predictions show how the market will change over the years. This dataset was sourced from Kaggle. After performing the EDA and preparing the data, I trained the model using different regression techniques like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Regression and then finally evaluated the best fit with R-squared value.
